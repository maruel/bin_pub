Updating .bash_aliases:
OSX won't load .bash_aliases by default, unlike cygwin or Ubuntu's default
.bashrc because no .bashrc or .profile is provided by default.
- .profile is needed when opening a new terminal.
- .bashrc is needed when creating a terminal in screen (non-login session).
Run:
  echo "source ~/.bash_aliases" >> ~/.bashrc
  echo "source ~/.bash_aliases" >> ~/.profile

Updating Bash
OSX 10.9 includes bash 3.2, which is too old for git-prompt. To install bash,
you need brew. Let's install it for the user only. This requires XCode and
command line tools. Once both are installed, run:
  ~/bin/bin_pub/setup_scripts/install_brew.sh
  brew install bash

  # Must be exactly $HOME/bin/homebrew/bin/bash
  which bash

  # Add the line printed above at the very bottom of this file.
  # WARNING: Don't mess up, you could lock everyone out of this computer.
  sudo vi /etc/shells

  # WARNING: At that point, deleting homebrew will likely lock you out of your
  # account.
  chsh -s $HOME/bin/homebrew/bin/bash

  brew install tmux
